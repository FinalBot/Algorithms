# TypeScript Starter
This solution contains two key files:

1. **solve.ts** is a TypeScript file containing a single function called **solve**. This is the entry point to your solution.
1. **tester.html** is a simple test harness that allows you to easily test your solution against different inputs.

The target file to submit as your solution is **solve.js** (not solve.ts).
